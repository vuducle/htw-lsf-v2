## General Instructions:

- When generating new TypeScript code, please follow the existing coding style.
- Ensure all new functions and classes have JSDoc comments.
- Use SwaggerUI for the documentation for the backend.
- Prefer functional programming paradigms where appropriate.
- All code should be compatible with TypeScript 5.0 and Node.js 20+.
- The project structure is written with Nestjs
- The stack is with Prisma, JWT, Redis, PostgreSQL
- Think like a lecturer, its an app to grade the students enrollment and so on, you can create enrollments for the students
- Use yarn, dont use git
- 
## Coding Style:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Interface names should be prefixed with `I` (e.g., `IUserService`).
- Private class members should be prefixed with an underscore (`_`).
- Always use strict equality (`===` and `!==`).

## Regarding Dependencies:

- Avoid introducing new external dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- If a new dependency is required, please state the reason.
